# Strings
    +- Immutable (can NOT be changed)
    +- When modifying the string, the string is not changed but replaced.
        + EX 
            let myString = "Hello";
            myString.concat(" there");
            console.log(myString); // Prints "Hello"
            myString = myString.concat(" there");
            console.log(myString); // Prints "Hello there"

        +- In order to properly modify string it must be redeclared as the edited version
